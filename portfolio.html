  <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
  <p>Below is a collection of some of the work that I've been able to produce and get published throughout my college career.</p>

  <p>As you can see, most of the stories deal with environmental or social issues, which are what I find the most interesting to report on. I've been lucky to get to pursue my interests so much at the school of journalism!</p>

  <p>Hope you enjoy, and, as always, feel free to reach out to me if you have questions or want to know more about the reporting process.</p>

<p> Mr. Garvin help! I was able to embed that video but I couldn't find the embed code for the others because they were via KOMU! For the first KOMU video, I was able to left click and find the "video address," but it didn't work for the others. I missed office hours but wanted to add the rest of mine to be on here eventually, so I was letting you know!</p>
<p> I want to have the videos in these stories attached:

<p> For the above text piece, I was trying to figure out if there was a way to embed a web page in a more visually appealing way than just using a link? </p>
